# VR_for_DroneSwarms

• Modelling swarming behaviour in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Using Physicomimetic model and Couzin’s swarming models to create leader-based and pray-seeking swarms. 

• Designing drone controllers working based on user input while utilizing game physics to create a dynamic and interactive simulation of drone flight. Implementing features such as throttle control, pitch, yaw, and roll control.

• Utilizing the HTC Vive virtual reality (VR) headset, along with the OpenXR and SteamVR frameworks, to create an immersive and interactive experience to control the swarms. Locomoting and engaging with the pray/goal object to observe the behaviour of the pray-seeking model.
